# WinDevWorkshop
Hands on Workshop for Windows 10 Developer Training

This workshop is based on the _full_ Windows Dev Camp set of materials, which is in turn based on the "Developer's Guide to Windows 10" which was produced as a set of on demand video training on both Channel 9 and Microsoft Virtual Academy.

The purpose of the Workshop is to provide a more interactive developer training experience that minimizes lecture in favor of more instructor led lab experiences.

Each module contains a minimal PPT deck and one or more 'hands on labs' for direct delivery in a classroom setting.
